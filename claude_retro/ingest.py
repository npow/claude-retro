"""JSONL parsing and ingestion — delegated to sessionlog.ingest.

sessionlog.ingest provides:
- Correct agent_progress / bash_progress parsing (parentUuid on outer record)
- progress_entries table population
- conn.commit() fix (writes were previously lost)
- WAL-safe readers via autocommit connections

All public functions re-exported unchanged; callers in claude-retro continue
to work without modification.
